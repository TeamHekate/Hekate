# Hekate: An Educational Microcontroller Simulator with Physical I/O Capabilities
Hekate was made by (and named after) the members of TeamHekate as a senior graduation project for Atılım University, Spring, 2025. The project aims to support classroom and hobbyist environments by providing an easily accessible and intuitive simulator to teach the basics of microcontrollers. Currently, it has over 50 instructions, supporting basic arithmetic-logic operations, conditional jumps, and 8-bit (1.3.4 adaptation of IEEE-754) floating point operations. Alongside the instruction set architecture defined specifically for the teaching of the fundamentals of computer engineering and sciences, the simulator also provides the capability of mapping serial port devices as memory-mapped I/O devices that can be written to and read from using basic move instructions.
## Instructions and Manual
Currently, the documentation is not complete. However, do expect it to be finished and released within the project soon.
## Building the Project
The project can be built using Dotnet 7.0+, on which it was developed.
## Acknowledgements
We thank Associate Professor Erhan Gökçay of Atılım University for his support and supervision throughout our project. Thanks to his guidance, we were able to design an ISA that would be perfect for a classroom environment. We also thank Professor Doctor A. Yavuz Oruç for inspiring our team to develop our very own educational simulator, with whom one of our members is currently working on the [CodeAPeel](https://www.codeapeel.org/) project. Without them, this project would never have been born.
